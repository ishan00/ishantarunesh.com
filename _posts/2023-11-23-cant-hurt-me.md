Challenge #5: Visualising Success.

Imagine the goal you want to achieve. Imaging the obstacles in between. Imagine how you will overcome them. Imagine the points you will want to quit and what you’ll do when you come to them. Don’t just imagine the goal, imagine the complete path. This will make you prepared to take the challenge.
