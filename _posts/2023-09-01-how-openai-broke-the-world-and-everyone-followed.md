Dubbed the \"Generative AI Revolution,\" this groundbreaking innovation
is rewriting the rules of creativity and problem-solving across diverse
fields---from art and music to healthcare and engineering. As it imbues
machines with the ability to create, innovate, and even \"think\" in
ways previously considered the unique domain of human intelligence, the
implications are exhilarating. This post serves as a rich repository of
hyperlinks covering how we got here, the emergence of Gen AI startups,
and its implications on different industries.

OpenAI released [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)
on November 30, 2022. A chatbot that can plan a travel itinerary for you
with only â‚¹20,000 to spare and a small suitcase enough for 5 days. It
was a glimpse of what talking to an "Intelligent" computer program could
look like. And it went viral, reaching the coveted 100 million users
mark in just 5 months.

ChatGPT marks its name in history by being the first **consumer-facing**
**generative** AI application. It can converse in a human-like way and
generate a unique response each time (based on the context provided).
These 2 factors make it transformational, quite like the dawn of
consumer internet apps in the early 2000s. ChatGPT can [transcribe an
audio or video](https://transcript.lol/), [provide
interactive summaries of
podcasts](https://twitter.com/transitive_bs/status/1646907018903707649),
[compose poems on breaking into a
house](https://twitter.com/JustAnkurBagchi/status/1598212707500498944?lang=en),
and even ["discover" a faster sorting
algorithm](https://twitter.com/DimitrisPapail/status/1666843952824168465).
It also generated the first paragraph of this post ðŸ™‚.

The seed of development of this line of research was sowed in 2017 with
the groundbreaking paper titled "[Attention is all you
need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)"
which introduced transformers and self-attention. In 2018, researchers
at Google published a new language representation model called
[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), which was
pre-trained on a large volume of texts using a combination of masked
language and next-sentence prediction strategies. At the time, BERT and
models built subsequently over it
([RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692),
[DeBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03654), etc.) topped
the chart on the [GLUE
benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/). (Read more about
the [history of transformers](https://archive.vn/xAdam).)

OpenAI, founded by Sam Altman in 2015, led the effort to build
large-scale transformer models, which they called Generative Pre-trained
Transformers (GPTs). The first iteration, GPT-1, contained only 117
million parameters and produced text easily identifiable as non-human
generated. The release of GPT-3 was a big leap (with 175 billion). The
model started producing long texts of prose.

OpenAI, initially a non-profit with the vision of building [Artificial
General
Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)
(AGI), received backing from Elon Musk and a further [\$3
billion](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/23/microsoft-invests-billions-more-dollars-in-openai-extends-partnership/)
from Microsoft in 2019.

Post the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft, realizing the immense
world-changing potential of AI and the follow-on effects of it on cloud
computing, invested another [\$10
billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html)
to take its stake in OpenAI to a whopping 49%. Other investors &
employees also own 49%, with the original OpenAI Non-Profit retaining
just
[2%](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/23/microsoft-invests-billions-more-dollars-in-openai-extends-partnership/).
OpenAI had to convert to a "(capped) for-profit" entity at this point,
meaning that the returns to investors and employees are capped. However,
the OpenAI Non-Profit still has full control of the capped-profit entity
and receives all profit in excess of the defined cap. You can read more
about the structure
[here](https://openai.com/our-structure). Even Sam Altman,
their CEO, does not hold any direct equity. He has a small indirect
equity from being a Y-Combinator investor who invested a small sum into
OpenAI.

Post the blowup of ChatGPT, OpenAI released GPT-4, the successor of
GPT-3 (the model on which ChatGPT was first trained), launched in March
2023, [passes numerous competitive
exams](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) with flying
colors, a 90th percentile score on the bar exam, 88th percentile on
LSAT, and 99th percentile on GRE (Verbal).

Parallelly brewing was the text-to-image revolution that shares the
model architecture in terms of the use of large transformer language
models for encoding text for image synthesis. One of the first
text-to-image models to capture widespread public attention was
[DALL-E](https://openai.com/research/dall-e) (also by
OpenAI), released in January 2021. By 2022, the output of
state-of-the-art models, such as OpenAI's [DALL-E
2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), Google Brain's
[Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/), Stability AI's
[Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/), and
[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/)
began to approach the quality of real photographs and human-drawn art.
Jason Allen's [AI-generated artwork using Midjourney won the Colorado
State Fair's annual art
competition](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html)
(shown below), starting a debate on what comprises art.

From the list above, Midjourney deserves a special mention for taking on
giants while being a small, self-funded team of only 11 full-time
members (in comparison, Stability AI raised \$100M and has roughly 185
members).

### **The Rise of AI Startups in India**

Since the launch of ChatGPT, the number of Generative AI-led SaaS
startups in India has more than [doubled since 2021 to
60](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gen-ai-startups-more-than-double-in-2023-raising-590-million-in-funding-report-11043661.html),
with \$590 million in cumulative funding and \$475 million since 2021.
Of this, a major chunk (\~[\$240
million](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/business-messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-240-million-from-tiger-global-fidelity-and-others/))
was raised by Gupshup, which had been used to acquire Active.AI and
develop its [in-house conversational
AI](https://www.gupshup.io/generative-ai-platform/ace-llm)
to automate customer support. 90% of the total funding, however, went to
incumbents (Gupshup, Observe.ai
[\$125M](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/12/observe-ai-raises-125m-adding-zoom-as-an-investor-to-supercharge-the-contact-center-market/),
MadStreetDen
[\$30M](https://inc42.com/buzz/ai-startup-mad-street-den-secures-30-mn-funding-to-widen-offerings/),
PepperContent
[\$14M](https://www.peppercontent.io/blog/pepper-content-raises-14-3m-series-a-funding-led-by-bessemer-venture-partners/)),
with only \~\$50 million invested into companies started since 2021.

Overall, in 2022, AI startups received [\$3.2
billion](https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/india-ranks-fifth-in-ai-startup-investments-receives-3-24bn-in-2022-stanford-report-11681314138709.html)
in funding out of a total of \$25 billion deployed. However, Generative
AI is only a fraction of this, as - 1) it is incredibly hard to build a
generative AI model, and 2) it has only come into the limelight since
the launch of ChatGPT.

<img src="images/how-openai-broke-the-world/image2.png" style="width: 100%">

The above graphic is taken out of the "Generative AI Startup Landscape
in India" report by Nasscom. There are 2 major takeaways from this -

1)  Observe the stack on the left side to understand that there are 5
    > broad layers in the GenAI Ecosystem. It begins with Industry
    > Demand (5) that needs to be served. Then there are Applications,
    > Products(3), and services (4) that can serve this demand with the
    > help of GenAI. For this, they need a foundational AI model, which
    > they can either build in-house or use something like GPT-4, LLaMA
    > (by Meta), BLOOM (by HuggingFace) and many others.

2)  More importantly, while there are plenty of recognizable names on
    > the Application side, there is a glaring gap as currently there
    > are no AI Foundational Models being built in India. This could be
    > a major loss, especially if we consider the foundational model to
    > be the real innovation and likely to capture all the value in the
    > future.

Sam Altman recently visited India in June 2023, and on being asked if he
sees a foundational AI model being built out of India, Altman bluntly
replied that one could try, but it is going to be hopeless, but one
should try anyway. In other words, it is going to be extremely difficult
to build a foundational model in India because it requires money and a
certain infrastructure, and those are hard to come by. He added later
that the question of doing something that he thinks can't be done is
something that only builders can answer. Rajan Anandan (MD, Peak XV
Partners) asked the question, and Anand Mahindra
[accepted](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/challenge-is-on-days-after-sam-altmans-india-visit-tech-mahindras-ai-think-tank-is-action-ready-385489-2023-06-14)
the challenge.

But there's some truth to this. Over this year, lots of startups have
popped up ([Glean](https://www.glean.com/),
[Fini](https://www.usefini.com/), etc. ) that would run
the models with the context of private databases of companies, which
could then be used to address customer queries, generate FAQs, and or
even do advanced data crunching. A single knowledge hub of a company
that can answer any and all questions (technical and non-technical).
OpenAI launched [ChatGPT
Enterprise](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise)
3 days back (28th August) that did just that.

"From engineers troubleshooting bugs to data analysts clustering
free-form data, to finance analysts writing tricky spreadsheet
formulas---the use cases for ChatGPT Enterprise are plenty. It's become
a true enabler of productivity, with the dependable security and data
privacy controls we need."

\- Danny Wu, Head of AI Products at Canva

<img src="images/how-openai-broke-the-world/image3.png" style="width: 100%">

And Open AI has plans to do more and take up as much of the pie as it
can. And it can do so legitimately since it is the builder and owner of
the foundational AI model that has disrupted the market. The presence of
the large foundational models for text and images has made it easier for
companies to build products directly. In the past, these companies could
not have existed due to simply the lack of (artificial) intelligence
capabilities. Now, that intelligence can be accessed via APIs costing as
little as \$0.02 per action.

Facebook has, however,
[open-sourced](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/)
its foundational model, LLaMA, along with the configuration needed for
anyone to run it on their own. Even if it took hundreds of millions of
dollars to make a foundational model, a model, once built, can be
finetuned for a few thousand dollars to perform well on a specific task
and even outperform a general model like GPT-4.

### **Ease of building an AI tool/product**: 

AI Startups raised a mammoth amount of money last year \-- Inflection AI
raised
[\$1.3B](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/inflection-ai-lands-1-3b-investment-to-build-more-personal-ai/)
to build more personal AI, thus valuing it at \$4B. Character.ai raised
over
[\$200M](https://www.ft.com/content/b230eb4c-ed53-45ff-8b64-c286a4b98fc1)
Series A to become a unicorn. Mistral AI raised a
[\$113M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-week-old-ai-startup-170118438.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKjWLDSXgvYzbB3kuCrM_XZmg2SRyCJcvX191wq7mhkUlfJfs7f4WZ-gwOH3tUMzSkIGv5zWxZkM0mFqDIc33-nBo-h4OvgfRntF1w7Od5LY05a_DREws3iQIMg6Pl2NGdaxTqNmxXy3upQB0SrnPTNQCLmy3N5pU7V0RkqsGC-Y)
seed round in just 4 weeks of existence, with just a pitch
[memo](https://sifted.eu/articles/pitch-deck-mistral).

Building an AI product has become easier than ever. A whole new job of
leveraging the power of these large foundational models has emerged
called prompt engineering. Naturally, the question arises on the
defensibility of these startups or if they even add as much value as
they had been valued at.

#### Defensibility of Startups

LLMs have made large-scale general data a non-necessity. Small startups
can now leverage the power of these models through API and package it
into a product. The foundational models themselves are a stronger moat
because they cost a lot and take time to build. But they are also not
unbeatable because most of the data they were trained on is publicly
available (GPT-3 and Stable diffusion were trained on public datasets).
Meta went a step ahead and open-sourced their LLaMA 2 model with weights
that can be finetuned and self-hosted by companies. The open-source
community, too, has made great strides in building smaller models that
can match (or even surpass) the capability of ChatGPT or GPT-4 on
specific tasks. [EleutherIA](https://www.eleuther.ai/) is
a non-profit research institute that evolved from a Discord server and
released its GPT Neo family of models with sizes ranging from 125M to
20B parameters. There's also the
[BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience) family of
models by HuggingFace, a result of the largest collaboration of AI
researchers worldwide. With 176 billion parameters, BLOOM can generate
text in 46 languages.

One of the interesting arguments around this was actually from Chamath
Palihapitiya, of Facebook fame, who now runs his own venture capital
firm, Social Capital. He made the point that once we get to a point
where AI is readily available and being used by all major companies, it
is going to massively change the mergers and acquisition strategies of
these large companies. There is going to be much more value being
ascribed to proprietary data (v/s currently the foundational models
trained on public data), and companies will get acquired because they
will have data that could be good inputs for a larger AI model of the
acquirer. You can listen to him
[here](https://youtu.be/pD-JqDA1In8?si=47g-hZRtwerEXZhE&t=1341).

As LLMs and AI get more widespread adoption, there could be larger
geo-political implications. Take, for example, the recent Digital
Personal Data Protection Bill of 2023 that limits the cross-border
transfer of data. It could easily be extended to limit the training of
models with peculiarities of Indian consumer data or even prevent a
pre-trained model from operating on Indian data. Such regulations can
also create or destroy moats around Indian startups specifically.

### **Industries witnessing GenAI revolution**

**Customer Service:** Gen AI has already disrupted the customer service
industry. Dukaan [laid off
90%](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/dukaan-lays-off-90-staff-for-ai-bot-attributes-decision-to-focus-on-profitability/articleshow/101666619.cms?from=mdr)
of their customer support staff due to their AI bot. They even made a
product ([bot9.ai](https://bot9.ai/)) out of it that other
startups can use.According to a [recent report by
Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-03-gartner-poll-finds-45-percent-of-executives-say-chatgpt-has-prompted-an-increase-in-ai-investment),
70% of organizations are currently exploring Gen AI, with customer
experience being the primary focus. Every touchpoint in the customer
journey is witnessing automation with more personalized human-like
assistance through chat/voice agents. Read BCG's report on the
[transformation of customer service through Gen
AI](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-generative-ai-transforms-customer-service).

**Media and Entertainment:** AI has drastically reduced the cost of
producing content. With a subscription of \$82/month, you can generate
up to 100,000 words per month using
[Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/). Jasper raised a
[\$125M](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/ai-content-platform-jasper-raises-125m-at-a-1-7b-valuation/)
Series A at a \$1.5B valuation and has fierce competition from
[Writesonic](https://writesonic.com/), Writer,
[Hypotenuse AI](https://www.hypotenuse.ai/), Quibot,
Surfer, etc., in the AI content space. The job of a content writer is
witnessing a similar crisis as a customer service agent. While text
models and text-to-image models are showing human-like capabilities,
video models are still brewing for the next breakthrough, glimpses of
which can be seen in the [pizza commercial created by
Runway](https://twitter.com/aibreakfast/status/1650689809915215872?s=46&t=HCZfGAmOSrhh6M8wGTzWUw)
using their ML Gen-2 model. The content industry would be transformed by
interactive storytelling and personalized, immersive journeys

**Search Industry:** For the first time in its history, Google stands to
be disrupted in search - its crown jewel. ChatGPT transformed the way
users interact with the web. Getting a summarized and concise answer is
a better UX for users than a list of hyperlinks. Although ChatGPT is
lagging far behind in accuracy and coverage, it has started the
revolution of moving towards a conversational search. Microsoft, with
its acquisition of OpenAI, integrated the technology in Bing. Google,
standing at a crossroads with its ad business model at stake, had a
setback when its [market cap plunged by
\$100B](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/)
after its latest chatbot,
[Bard](https://bard.google.com/), shared inaccurate
information. It's a David-vs-Goliath moment with upcoming search
startups such as [Perplexity
AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) and
[Glean](https://www.glean.com/) (enterprise) quickly
integrating the LLMs

**Healthcare:** LLMs would unlock the creation of structured text from
unstructured data (medical reports). Patient communication, such as
reminders to checkups, would become conversational and personalized.
ChatGPT made news when it [diagnosed a life-threatening condition from
a user\'s post-workout
symptoms](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/ai-lifesaver-chatgpt-diagnoses-life-threatening-condition-in-reddit-users-post-workout-symptoms-article-100474023#:~:text=ChatGPT%20accurately%20diagnoses%20rare%20medical,by%20getting%20timely%20medical%20attention.).
Given how critical accuracy is in the medical domain, companies are
ramping up to build LLMs for the medical domain (check out [Med-PaLM
2](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/sharing-google-med-palm-2-medical-large-language-model)
by Google). See McKinsey's report on [tackling the biggest challenges
in healthcare using Gen
AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/tackling-healthcares-biggest-burdens-with-generative-ai)

**Education and Skill-development:** Chegg, an ed-tech company providing
online tutoring and homework help, saw its [stock fall by nearly
50%](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/edtech-chegg-slumps-revenue-warning-chatgpt-threatens-growth-2023-05-02/)
after the CEO acknowledged competition from ChatGPT. The traffic on
StackOverflow [dropped 13.9% in February and 17.7% in
March](https://gizmodo.com/stack-overflow-traffic-drops-as-coders-opt-for-chatgpt-1850427794),
establishing the supremacy of ChatGPT in not only providing answers to
everyday questions but also code snippets.

**E-commerce:** The experience of e-commerce is going to change with
visual search (virtual try-on). Customers would be able to see how the
product would appear on them. Google is already [making headway by
weaving GenAI into its
shopping](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/google-is-weaving-generative-ai-into-online-shopping-features/articleshow/100999643.cms?from=mdr)
features to take on Amazon. Recommendations would become more
personalized and convincing, with explanations provided to users about
why a product was suggested.

**Gaming Industry:** The use of Gen AI accelerates the game development
process by creating assets, writing dialogues, and generating levels.
Ubisoft unveiled its new AI writing program, Ghostwriter, which aids in
crafting phrases spoken by NPC characters. Roblox also launched a
similar AI-based tool for its game creators. Read more about different
games using Gen AI
[here](https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/gaming-ai-revolutionizing-generative-landscape-for-developers-and-gamers/)

### **Implication of AI in personal life and future of work**

**Increased productivity**: Knowledge workers would see a substantial
increase in their productivity with the adoption of AI tools. [Ben's
Bites](https://news.bensbites.co/), a newsletter featuring
the latest AI products, has a repository of 8000+ tools. We now have
tools for everything \-- note-taking and writing
([Mem](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-productivity-tools/#mem),
[Notion AI](https://www.notion.so/product/ai)), scheduling
([Reclaim](https://reclaim.ai/),
[Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/),
[Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/)), scraping websites
([Webscrape AI](https://webscrapeai.com/)), creating
websites ([Framer](https://www.framer.com/ai)), creating
AI videos ([Descript](https://www.descript.com/),
[Runway](https://runwayml.com/),
[Decoherence](https://www.decoherence.co/)), meeting
assistants ([Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai/),
[Krisp](https://krisp.ai/ai-meeting-assistant/),
[Airgram](https://www.airgram.io/)), create slide decks
([Beautiful.ai](https://www.beautiful.ai/),
[Decktopus](https://www.decktopus.com/)), or even to
evaluate your startup pitch
([Pitchyouridea.ai](https://www.pitchyouridea.ai/)). The
website [Supertools](https://supertools.therundown.ai/)
curates 1000s of such tools across categories.

**Future of work:** A recent
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) on the labor
market impact of LLMs highlights that 80% of the US workforce would have
10% of their task affected by LLMs. According to McKinsey's
[report](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-ten-things-to-solve-for),
around 3% of the global workforce will need to change the occupational
category by 2030. Quoting the report, "*Occupations made up of physical
activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or
collection will see declines. Growing occupations will include those
with difficult-to-automate activities, such as managers, and those in
unpredictable physical environments, such as plumbers."*
