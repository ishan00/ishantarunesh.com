I often grapple between the two philosophies of living your life.

The first one says that a balanced life is a life well-lived. This means working towards an equilibrium in every aspect of your life. If one becomes excessively engrossed in their career, it suggests recalibrating some of that energy towards relationships or hobbies. According to this idea your happiness is a product of happiness coming from every facet. Earning a handsome salary might lose its charm if there are no friends to celebrate with, and having a tight-knit circle of loved ones can feel incomplete if one's professional life is unfulfilling. One needs to invest moderately in every aspect like job, hobbies, friends, family, relationships etc.

Contrastingly, the second philosophy advocates that we should be doubling down on our strengths to achieve something. A well rounded life isn’t the one that leads to achievement. Achieving something requires trading-off other important things. Delving into the biographies of many who've achieved something great, you’ll get to know the things they sacrifised to be where they are -- hobbies, cherished moments with loved ones, or simple leisure activities. As Ben Horowitz says, "Lack of weakness is not a strength."
