Over the course of 12 years, we spend more than 20000 hours at school (6hrs a day, 6 days a week). That’s equivalent of a full-time job which we have come to detest in our adulthood for how much life it takes away from us. And you add the time to commute to it, due to lack of so-called good schools, you are spending another hour and half commuting daily. It begs the question: are we taking schooling too seriously? for the time it is taking away from a kids childhood?

What is that schooling is supposed to achieve? The aim of schooling is to equip the kids with fundamental skills like reading, writing, ability to do some maths, and a general understanding of other subjects such as history, political science, physics etc. Does it really require 20000 hours to achieve this? Given the curriculum, I think we come out of school absolutely hating many subjects due to rote-learning methods or bad teaching style. Another function of school is to teach kids, how to make friends and interact with people their age. I would consider this a better argument in favour of in-person schooling than the to teaching fundamental skills, which in my opinion, could be made more shorter through interesting and engaging ways of teaching.

And to add salt to the wound, is the concept of homework. As if spending 6 hrs in-person wasn’t enough for the day and you need to work on the lessons for additional 2-3 hours at home. And this is not it! Parents are enrolling their kids for private tutoring or coaching classes as early as class 1st. Parents are confusing the point of additional help. Don’t send your kids to coaching if they are scoring well at school. And conversely, if the kid is struggling, before putting them in a coaching, try to understand what the issue is. Maybe your kid isn’t fitting well in the school, or they don’t like the teacher’s method. Indian parents are taking coaching as a one-size-fit-all solution that they can blindly follow to absolve their responsibility.

What’s left in a kids life after all this? I have relatives who are still in middle school who go school on weekdays and full-day coaching classes on weekends. They have dropped going to play. I have a cousin who’s in 1st standards and has a personal tutor! The days are absurdly packed, there’s hardly time for leisure. 

Let the kids play for an hour. Let the kids relax and watch TV. Take them on a trip every few months. Indian parents won’t take a trip because their kids are going to miss school for a week? And somehow missing a week of school is catastrophic?? Parents are locking themselves up too in the process, living a very rigid life till the time their kids are in school. If you have to put them in a class, put them in a singing class or a sports camp. Take schools little less seriously and don’t let it take away childhood.
