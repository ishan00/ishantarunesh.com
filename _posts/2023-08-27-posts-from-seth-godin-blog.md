Liked these three posts.

## [Goals and expectations](https://seths.blog/2023/07/goals-and-expectations/)

> [a note to a frustrated friend, just starting out on a long career]

> There are three reasons that our goals might not be achieved. In order of palatability, they are:

> Perhaps the goals are too lofty, too based on chance, unlikely for anyone to achieve, surrounded by barriers that are rooted in class or caste, or simply unrealistic.

> If that’s the case, change expectations and/or pick different goals.

> Or, perhaps the goals are useful, but we need more persistence, more time and some hard-earned lucky breaks along the way.

> If so, be persistently patient.

> Alas, if it’s not these two, the most likely reason is that we need to walk away from our expectations and our insistence that we’re already doing the work perfectly. It could be that we need to expend more effort than we hoped, develop new skills, find and embrace new strategies and develop a taste for the emotional labor that’s required to get from here to there.

> Empathy, a cycle of skills improvement, developing new attitudes and showing up in service often accompanies the careers of people who get from here to there.

> Ambition is insufficient.

## [Raising the bar](https://seths.blog/2023/07/raising-the-bar/)

> That’s not the same as raising the average.

> With the advent of the high jump, the idiom raising the bar became well understood: If you can’t jump over the bar that the current leader cleared, you don’t win.

> But most of the innovations that change our culture don’t actually increase the simple linear measurements of the bar. They’re more likely to raise the average, to increase the performance of accepted mediocre output.

> McDonald’s didn’t raise the bar in terms of the best food it was possible to be served in a restaurant, but they made roadside dining faster, cheaper and more reliable.

> AI doesn’t raise the bar for illustration, copywriting or coding. But it certainly increases the average quality of a high school essay or the cheapest photo retouching or programming services.

> Autotune can’t compete with Eva Cassidy, but it turned millions of singers into slightly more palatable recording artists.

> Two traps worth avoiding:

> 1. When something seeks to raise the average, it’s tempting to criticize it for failing to raise the bar. It makes the good a little better, but it doesn’t do anything great. Sure, that’s true, but that’s not what it’s seeking to do (yet).

> 2. Failing to see that when we raise the average, it can diminish the breadth of demand for the extraordinary. Plenty of very, very good roadside restaurants were destroyed by fast food joints, because suddenly, good enough was good enough.

> The endless cycle of improvement means that every innovation that raises the average creates the conditions for a new sort of excellence. Using these tools, a new standard setter can find a different way forward and create a different way to raise the bar, one that seems obvious after the fact.

## [The low-stakes argument](https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-low-stakes-argument/)

> It’s tempting and fun to argue about the logo. About the way the toilet paper is hung. About how to load the trunk of the car.

> These sorts of arguments work precisely because they don’t matter. At all.

> And they distract us from the incredibly difficult work of discussing the things that actually do matter. That we can take action on. That are easier to ignore.
