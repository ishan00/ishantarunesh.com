The theory is simple. It suggests that our abilities and potential are not fixed; instead, they are incredibly adaptable, and we quickly align ourselves with the "container" we are placed in. Think of it this way: if you surround yourself with people who regularly exercise, you're more likely to adopt the same healthy habit. Conversely, if you find yourself in a job that fails to challenge or engage you, your skills are at risk of stagnation and decline.

Most of our growth comes from the surroundings we find ourselves in. Often, these environments aren't consciously chosen. We discover ourselves within new containers, and then, instinctively, we start to adapt.

I started focusing on fitness while I was in Korea. The main reason behind it was that many of my friends had started going to the gym, and they discussed it during lunchtime. I would never have been motivated to go myself, and had I not come around that set of friends, I probably would not have picked it up.

Conversely, my first job experience left me feeling stifled. There was a lack of challenging work, and I noticed my productivity dwindling. My attention span had decreased, and so had my ability to sit for long hours. Because I wasn’t challenged at all, I grew fearful and avoidant of more challenging tasks. The container was small, and I ended up adapting to the container. 

The IIT container was very, very big, and I didn’t even come close to expanding myself. That will always remain a big regret for me. I closely saw people being great at whatever they do — study, extracurricular, socializing, etc. At that time, I couldn’t positively see all of this, and I ended up secluding myself from most opportunities. 

Breaking free from a container, whether one we've voluntarily entered or stumbled into by chance, requires significant effort and conscious intention. Thus, improvement and growth become a challenge of putting yourself in containers that are (i) bigger and harder and (ii) where you’ll find a good fit and then allow yourself to expand to that container.
