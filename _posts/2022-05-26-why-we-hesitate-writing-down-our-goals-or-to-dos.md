It is not a lack of wishes but rather too many of them that are at the root of this problem. It’s easy to come up with things you would like to explore / work on / improve in the future. Sit without your phone for an hour and you’ll be able to come up with many. The hard part is when someone asks you to choose 1 or few out of them. In essence goal setting is not simply “what I want to do” but also “what I don’t want to do”. By setting goals (or systems or habits or other equivalent words) you are qualifying how you envision the future for yourself. That means letting go of many of the half-baked wishes in your head. You have to go through the sadness and grief of what you won’t do and who you’ll never be.
