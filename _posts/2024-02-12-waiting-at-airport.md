"Ugh, four hours of waiting? It's like the epitome of boredom," groaned Vaishnavi, dropping her luggage onto the bench. "I mean, it's only a 1 hour and 45 minute ride to Bangalore. Can you believe this 4-hour delay?"

Arjun, his demeanor as calm as ever, gently closed his book and settled onto the seat. Catching Vaishnavi's agitated expression, he offered, "You know, it's not the worst place to be." He paused "I have a little game I play when I'm traveling alone. We have to guess why someone is at the airport and where they might be headed. What do you say?"

"Is this your way of saying we're going people-watching, like you always do?" Vaishnavi teased. "Sorry, I don't want to get caught staring at strangers."

Arjun Chuckled, "Fair enough. I'll go first then."

"See that pair over there? With the aggressive hand-holding and intense eye contact? Definitely going on their honeymoon."

Vaishnavi rolled her eyes. "Nah, Arjun. That's just regular couple stuff. Not everyone is as unromantic as you."

“So you are enjoying the game now, huh?” complained Arjun. "Yeah, yeah, go on," Vaishnavi replied in a playful voice.

“That guy who’s on the phone call with a laptop, I bet he’s some millionaire going for a business deal” said Arjun. “Or simply a management consultant”, laughed Vaishnavi, “They appear serious like that.” she continued.

Arjun laughed. "Haha true."

“What about that kid over their sulking, looks like his parents are transferring him to a boarding school”, speculated Arjun, trying to sound convincing. 

Vaishnavi shaking her head, “Not at all Arjun. Can’t you see? They are on a family trip. He’s just upset because he didn’t get to buy overpriced chips”

"I find airports amusing," Arjun said, looking over the bustling terminal.

"You find airports amusing?" Vaishnavi laughed. "Sometimes I forget why I even like you."

“Everyone appears homogenous, with crumpled clothes and a hint of agitation, but beneath this uniformity lies the diversity of their individual lives.” Arjun remarked. 

“There’s always someone who’s moving to a new city for job, and then there is someone going back home after a year. A corporate executive going for a business deal, and others going on a vacation, to take time away from grind.” he continued. 

“Someone is filled with joy seeing her kids waiting at the arrivals, for someone else, grief and responsiblity overwhelms them for there is a loss in their family. For some it’s the start of a new phase of life, for others it’s an insignificant day. And you know the best thing? You can’t really make out who is who. It’s one of the only place where stories so vastly different collide for a brief interim as everyone patiently waits for their life to resume again, except the management consultant who is busy tracking his billable hours”, Arjun paused gasping for breath.

“For the extra lucky ones, their girlfriend has come to pick them up at the Kempegowda Airport.” teased Arjun, with a coy smile. “I will never be that girlfriend Arjun, to make it clear” chuckled Vaishnavi.

"What do you suppose people think of us, Arjun? I bet they see us as a cute couple," Vaishnavi speculated with a playful grin.

Arjun chuckled. "Nah, they likely think we're siblings," he replied with a laugh.

"Shut the fuck up, Arjun" Vaishnavi said softly, gently wrapping her arm around his and squeezing his hand affectionately. "Better now"
