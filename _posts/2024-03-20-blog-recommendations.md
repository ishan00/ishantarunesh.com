*The thing about coolness is that you don’t start out knowing how to be cool, because you don’t start out knowing what you like. You start out—as we all do—by imitating. The very first thing we do when we are babies is imitate. We look at adults sticking their tongues out at us, and we do the same. This extends to early childhood. One of our friends is playing with Yu-Gi-Oh cards or Polly Pockets, and we think: hey those are cool, I want some. So, we collect and collect and collect. Then we shed. We keep the stuff we actually spend time with, the stuff we truly enjoy. This is when we start fixating on the things we especially like—this is how we develop taste! It’s the stuff we keep, not because we think it will seem cool to others, but because it’s cool to us.*

*I’ve noticed something unusual recently: the treadmill I run on at the gym has these black screens attached to them where people can watch TV. Since I have no desire to watch the weather channel or the news, I leave it turned off. So as I’m running, I see this blurry, imperfect reflection of myself bouncing up and down on the screen at the pace of my jog. I see myself sweat, breathe hard, go faster. And there’s something about looking directly at my reflection that makes me think think: you can try harder than the girl you are looking at. And so I do. I go faster. Sweat more. Breathe heavier. I push myself to compete with my reflection.*

*When asked about her motivation for writing "Your Best American Girl", Mitski said: “I wasn’t trying to send a message. I was in love. I loved somebody so much, but I also realized I can never be what would fit into their life.”*

*We would commiserate with each other about how high school felt like a farce, like a four-year-long audition, and then we would go on to attend Ivies and top state universities and small liberal arts colleges and we would eventually switch our majors to something safe, like economics or computer science. And we would rebel, sure; we would dance on tabletops and kiss the wrong person and backpack through Europe, but inevitably, the intoxicating allure of the corporate world and all of its comforts would yank us back to the paths drawn for us before we were born. And by age thirty, we would make six-figures annually; we would have a mortgage, two-point-one kids, and a nice house in a nice neighborhood, and we would have grown into the boring-ass adults we swore we’d never be.*

*When his parents worry about his job and its long hours, Avent observes the disconnect: They are asking him about his “work,” he says, but “I am thinking about identity, community, purpose – the things that provide meaning and motivation. I am talking about my life.”*

*Our whole lives we search for significance only to find that we can’t predict where it’ll come from next. A melody on the radio, an unlikely book, a first encounter with someone new, a stroll through an old Victorian neighborhood, getting an Italian combo from the deli. That’s the fun part. You can’t design a path with an imperfect world. The map always melts.*

*The mysterious reward of the human experience is not just to get what we want but to find something worth wanting. Something worth negotiating with reality for. Joy arises from the challenge of exertion, the thorough search to find it.*

*For the next ten hours, Zhang repeated a simple, exhausting task: he picked up a box of lemons and loaded them into a truck. He picked up a box of lemons and loaded them into the truck. He picked up the lemons and loaded them into the truck. The weight and repetition gnawed at the muscles of his forearm, the small of his back, the soles of his feet. At half-past six, Zhang would put down the boxes – this time for the night – and reverse the long journey home.*
