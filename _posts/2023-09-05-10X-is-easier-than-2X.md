“If you wanted to improve your profits by ten percent, how would you do it?”

I once attended marketing expert Joe Polish’s entrepreneur mastermind group, where he presented this and several other questions.

﻿
After taking 5 to 10 minutes to think through Joe’s questions, we had a group discussion. Dr. Alan Barnard, one of the world’s leading experts on constraint theory and decision-making, happened to be in the group that day.

﻿
“This is actually a really bad question,” stated Dr. Barnard. He then continued:

“There are literally infinite things I could do to grow my profits by ten percent. The goal isn’t big enough to create focus and specificity. If, however, you asked, ‘If you wanted to grow your profits by ten times, how would you do it?’ that would be a much better question because there are likely to be very FEW, maybe even only ONE way to create 10x growth. Indeed, almost nothing you’re currently doing would get you there. To separate the signal from the noise, you need to make the goal big enough to weed-out most paths or strategies. Impossible goals help you identify the ONE or FEW conditions that have the highest possible upside. Those are the areas to focus your scarcest resource - your limited attention on.”

“Seemingly impossible or massive goals are highly practical because they immediately separate what works from what won’t, illuminating the few paths that have the greatest efficacy.
Small goals are unable to clarify effective pathways because they are too marginal or linear from your current location.
This is a fundamental reason why 10x goals and vision are simpler, easier, and more practical than 2x goals. With a 2x goal, there are too many potential pathways to reach the desired destination. This creates paralysis-by-analysis and makes it extremely difficult to know where to focus your best energy and effort.
Conversely, with a 10x goal, only a limited number of strategies or paths will work.”

“The only way to make your present better,” said Dan Sullivan, “is by making your future bigger.”

“Without a clear goal, you can’t define the 20 percent that will effectively get you there and the 80 percent that’s taking you some other direction. Even still, when a goal isn’t much different from your current position, then you won’t need to change much to get there. Thus, you won’t need to separate the 80 from the 20, because when the destination or transformation is minor, then very little needs to change about what you’re now doing. This makes it difficult to pin-point where to focus your efforts and change and also stops you from identifying the 80 percent you’re still maintaining that isn’t serving you.
Small goals don’t require 80/20 thinking, because small goals don’t require much adjustment from your current approach.
Thus, the second requirement for separating the 20 percent that matters and the 80 that’s taking you some other way is setting much bigger goals.”
