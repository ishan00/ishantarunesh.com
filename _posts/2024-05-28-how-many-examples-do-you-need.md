To evaluate how difficult something is, we count the number of people who have done it. Plenty of my friends go to gym and lift heavy, so it should be easy. Many college seniors run their own startup so it can’t be that difficult. But how many examples should one search for before attempting that thing?

People go about trying to find tens or hundreds of examples until they can convince themself to try that. For most hard things you would never find that many examples off your hand. If 1% people do well in Startup (replace with UPSC, JEE, PhD) then ideally your search should only validate the same 1% (or 5% if your peer group is great). This search will be in vain, if hearing of any failure would have set you back on your decision.

I think only a few (1 or 2) close examples should be enough a reason to attempt it. By close I mean people who you know have similar profile (background, capability or advantages / disadvantages). This person should not have an unfair advantage you are unaware of, for you would beat yourself up if you don’t get the same result. For friends, you often know the complete picture, and thus a friend doing something is a good signal that the thing is achievable (with hard work ofcourse). But you may want to do things, none of your friends are into, so instead you look for examples out there. Reading about people who have made it big or networking with people who are ahead helps in this aspect. You try to match someone’s background to yours.

In one of Shark Tank’s episode, Radhika Gupta, was talking about giving birth to her son, while she held the post of CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Funds. She talked how difficult it was to manage both so she looked for examples of women who have done it and the only example she found was Marissa Mayer. This single example was enough for her to say - If Marissa can do it so can I.
