“Most people think that Kharagpur is a town which has nothing except an IIT (Indian Institute of Technology). Kharagpur is actually quite a cosmopolitan railway town, and you can hear most Indian languages being spoken there. Locals are more proud of the world’s longest railway platform than the IIT, and many feel that walking up and down this over a mile long platform kept railway ticket inspector M.S. Dhoni fit as he started his cricketing journey.”

“In 1999, I was heading marketing services for its computers business. Wipro was never big on ad spends and, on most days, I was hardly doing anything worthwhile and feeling quite guilty.
So one day, I ran a small test.
I did not come to work for two days—Tuesday and Wednesday—and I did not inform anyone about my absence. On Thursday, I was back at my desk and started fiddling around with some papers wondering when someone would come up and ask me why I did not come in for the past couple of days. Surprise, surprise—no one asked and what’s more, people around me continued talking and interacting with me as always. That’s when I realized that my absence would not mean much either way. I also learnt the first half of an important lesson—in large corporate bodies sometimes things can happen without you doing anything.
A year later as an entrepreneur I learnt the other half of the lesson—that in a start-up nothing will ever happen unless you do it or make it happen.”

A recent complaint against start-ups in India is that they are not solving ‘uniquely Indian problems’. I am afraid this is not going to happen anytime soon. To solve Indian problems, entrepreneurs need time and money. Most of the capital backing Indian start-ups is foreign capital. Foreign funds invest in Indian start-ups hoping to exit in a few years and return the money to their sponsors—the people outside India who gave them the funds to invest. Due to this exit time pressure, foreign funds are not in a position to provide entrepreneurs the longer duration required to solve Indian problems.

In addition, overseas funds need to have a broad exit idea when they invest, and the most persuasive one is to get acquired by a global giant. Perforce, these investors are happy to back clones of American start-ups hoping to get acquired by the original when they enter India whereas backing a founder attempting to solve a uniquely Indian problem increases their exit risk. Of late, Indian capital is more accessible, and hopefully some of these will get deployed to solve Indian problems.

Better, faster, cheaper

I have a simple rule to evaluate start-ups, and I call it the BFC test. A start-up must be able to improve existing products or services in the market by doing it better, faster or cheaper at scale. Think about it. There is nothing else that can be done or needs to be done. Depending on the number of boxes you can tick, your business is better off and more promising.

There are two types of shoppers. Shoppers who know precisely what they want and shoppers who have a vague idea of what they may want but are unsure. Sure shoppers typically walk up to the counter clerk and ask for ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ by Pink Floyd or ‘Catch 22’ by Joseph Heller while the unsure ones may either ask the counter person for Pankaj Udhas albums or locate the management books section and look through the titles to see if they could find something interesting. E-commerce sites deal with these two types of shoppers through two different navigational elements—the search box and the browse bars.
