“Most people think that Kharagpur is a town which has nothing except an IIT (Indian Institute of Technology). Kharagpur is actually quite a cosmopolitan railway town, and you can hear most Indian languages being spoken there. Locals are more proud of the world’s longest railway platform than the IIT, and many feel that walking up and down this over a mile long platform kept railway ticket inspector M.S. Dhoni fit as he started his cricketing journey.”

“In 1999, I was heading marketing services for its computers business. Wipro was never big on ad spends and, on most days, I was hardly doing anything worthwhile and feeling quite guilty.
So one day, I ran a small test.
I did not come to work for two days—Tuesday and Wednesday—and I did not inform anyone about my absence. On Thursday, I was back at my desk and started fiddling around with some papers wondering when someone would come up and ask me why I did not come in for the past couple of days. Surprise, surprise—no one asked and what’s more, people around me continued talking and interacting with me as always. That’s when I realized that my absence would not mean much either way. I also learnt the first half of an important lesson—in large corporate bodies sometimes things can happen without you doing anything.
A year later as an entrepreneur I learnt the other half of the lesson—that in a start-up nothing will ever happen unless you do it or make it happen.”

A recent complaint against start-ups in India is that they are not solving ‘uniquely Indian problems’. I am afraid this is not going to happen anytime soon. To solve Indian problems, entrepreneurs need time and money. Most of the capital backing Indian start-ups is foreign capital. Foreign funds invest in Indian start-ups hoping to exit in a few years and return the money to their sponsors—the people outside India who gave them the funds to invest. Due to this exit time pressure, foreign funds are not in a position to provide entrepreneurs the longer duration required to solve Indian problems.

In addition, overseas funds need to have a broad exit idea when they invest, and the most persuasive one is to get acquired by a global giant. Perforce, these investors are happy to back clones of American start-ups hoping to get acquired by the original when they enter India whereas backing a founder attempting to solve a uniquely Indian problem increases their exit risk. Of late, Indian capital is more accessible, and hopefully some of these will get deployed to solve Indian problems.

Better, faster, cheaper

I have a simple rule to evaluate start-ups, and I call it the BFC test. A start-up must be able to improve existing products or services in the market by doing it better, faster or cheaper at scale. Think about it. There is nothing else that can be done or needs to be done. Depending on the number of boxes you can tick, your business is better off and more promising.

There are two types of shoppers. Shoppers who know precisely what they want and shoppers who have a vague idea of what they may want but are unsure. Sure shoppers typically walk up to the counter clerk and ask for ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ by Pink Floyd or ‘Catch 22’ by Joseph Heller while the unsure ones may either ask the counter person for Pankaj Udhas albums or locate the management books section and look through the titles to see if they could find something interesting. E-commerce sites deal with these two types of shoppers through two different navigational elements—the search box and the browse bars.

“India’s first e-wallet
One day, a lady from Tinsukia, Assam, sent us a cheque for ₹50,000 and asked us to keep it as an advance and send her books she requested for till the money would run out. We managed this manually but the incident triggered the Fabmart wallet, India’s first e-wallet. Thousands of customers from remote locations used the wallet as an online payment option which proved to be a good option for many customers who wanted to pay COD.”

“There are several unique characteristics about online groceries which are still valid:

1. Gratification needs are urgent here. Customers need groceries now, not within two or three days.
2. The basket sizes (the number of items in the cart) are of a different order of magnitude. For e-commerce categories, the basket size is between 1 and 1.5 but for groceries it is around 35–40 items.
3. Fill rate is critical here. If you order five books from Amazon but they ship only four and cancel or delay the balance, it is not the end of the world. If you order 34 grocery items and the online store ships just 30 items, you still need to head out to the nearby supermarket immediately since the missed items may be needed for dinner tonight, in which case you might as well purchase everything at the supermarket.
4. To satisfy the above criteria, we realized that our strategy of operating from a single warehouse across India will not work. We needed a grocery warehouse in each city where we offered this service.
5. We observed that delivering groceries to housewives, our primary customer segment, was challenging. Different families had different schedules; most women shoppers wanted to check the items before payment. Some even wanted to physically feel items like rice and daal and sugar while taking deliveries, and we struggled to complete orders.

To make this process easier, we allowed customers to select two-hour time windows several times a day when they wanted their orders to be delivered. This created additional routing, transportation and logistics issues but customers loved the convenience and traction jumped. Time delivery slots are now industry standard for most online grocery stores.
6.There was another important shift in our strategy. Housewives were used to buying provisions, groceries, fresh fruits and vegetables in cash. Our plan of accepting payments only through credit/debit cards online came unstuck in the first few weeks itself. Multiple conversations with housewives indicated that they were open to buying groceries online but all of them preferred to pay COD.”

“In 2004, we stopped COD because it had several issues, most of which are still valid:
1. Courier companies charged an additional service fee to collect cash from customers which we could not afford within the low retail margins.
2. The administrative costs of collecting small amounts all over India and tracking them into our bank account were high and made no economic sense.
3. Since customers were not pre-paying online, there was no commitment; cancellations jumped and we incurred reverse transportation costs.
4. Customers started playing pranks and ‘gifted’ fridges and washing machines to their friends using COD and the joke was at our expense.
5. Thousands of our customers who were paying online shifted to COD.
6. Mobile resellers across India started sending their Bengaluru friends to our offices daily with bundles of cash to order latest phones in bulk at full price. Clearly, this was unaccounted money, and we did not want to become the medium for black-to-white conversions.
7. Customers shop online to save time and COD knocks this convenience out of the window. Imagine ordering a book online to get it home delivered and then waiting at home with cash along with the correct change for the delivery boy to turn up.”

“We learnt two lessons that day: make the surname field mandatory on the site for customers and always ship sensitive personal items like sanitary napkins and condoms in opaque packets.”

“Retail is a hard business to make money in, especially in India where gross margins are among the lowest globally. This is more so in groceries where high volumes and scale are necessary but sufficient conditions have not been built for a profitable business. Since selling prices are influenced by competitive activity, the best way to improve margins is to buy in large volumes and reduce buying prices. In fact, retailers generally make money by buying well instead of selling well. This sounds obvious but for grocery retailers, this is essentially the business model: insanely efficient buying.”

The first time Vivek Mohanty purchased books from us was when he was in an engineering college hostel in 2000. Later, he sent gifts to his parents in Bhubaneswar. In 2004, he got engaged to a girl in Delhi and sent her Valentine’s Day gifts, flowers, chocolates, perfumes and jewellery. When they got married in 2005, he gifted her KSIC silk saris popularly known as ‘Mysore Silk’.1 Later, Mohanty and his wife moved to Bengaluru and started working for a big IT services firm and continued to shop with us. In 2008, Mohanty ordered books on pregnancy and maternity wear for his wife and later infant toys and baby food.

Here’s the thing: if you stare at data from the right angles (meaning the correct angles and not 90 degrees), they will always narrate an interesting story. As we were staring at Mohanty’s history, it struck us that we could use such transactional histories (or herstories, pun intended) and weave together *life-cycle purchases*
Inspired by Mohanty, we targeted shoppers buying either maternity wear or books on pregnancy and offered them one or the other, followed by congratulations to mothers after ten months on their newborns, further followed by congratulations to mothers after ten months on their newborns, further followed by flowers, chocolates and a baby set and, later, offers on baby apparel and toys. The theme was expandable to cover other categories over time, depending on which part of the life cycle we start from. We extended this logic to the website as well. For the first time, on the pages of pregnancy-related books, the ‘People Who Bought This Also Bought…’ category showed options of not only more books but maternity wear and infant care items as well.

In October 2015, an armed robber grabbed some cash at gunpoint from a store in Maryland, walked out and hailed an Uber. The robber was caught by the cops later but that is another story. The incident demonstrates how boringly reliable hailing an Uber is in USA if armed robbers can depend on it as a getaway car.

Conventional logic suggests that if a company keeps all their customers happy, they will become a large and successful business. This is completely wrong.
Happy customers are a necessary but not sufficient condition to build a great business. Keeping customers happy is far easier than making money and Indian e-commerce companies are proof of this.
A great customer experience is one where customers are happy and the company makes money while providing this experience; if the cost of providing great customer experience is unsustainable, then it is actually poor customer experience.

Our human resources (HR) head once approached me with great concern. Highly funded e-commerce start-ups were attracting graduates from top engineering and management campuses at salaries apparently higher than what Google offered, and she was worried.
I was not worried.
Our competitors hired from top campuses which we never visited and if they were offering more than Google, then Google had to worry about it. At a headcount of around 120, it’s not as if we were going to lose thousands of people to competition. I just told her to push up interviewing and replace people who leave. Over the years, we lost less than ten people to competition.
Our people strategy was simple: look for smart, young and fresh talent from lesser known campuses and train them. India is full of bright people outside the reputed institutes and willing to work harder and deliver more at lower costs.

The biggest failure of start-ups has been the high cost of people. Most hyper-funded start-ups assumed that by merely employing people with pedigreed backgrounds from top campuses or from Silicon Valley and paying very high wages, organizational goals will be met. Fat chance.

“So, when other online bookstores were offering discounts, we offered insights. When Mark Gimenez’s novel The Color of Law was published, other sites offered the title at 40 per cent off, with free shipping. We emailed our customers how three iconic books—To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee), A Time to Kill (John Grisham) and The Color of Law—tackled the same sensitive theme so differently over five decades. Of course, we invited them to buy all three in a bundle that made money for us.
When discounted albums were the flavour of Independence Day celebrations, we procured audio recordings of Jawaharlal Nehru’s iconic India’s ‘Tryst with Destiny’ speech and offered to customers at full price plus shipping. Others discounted music, we retailed history.
When The Da Vinci Code DVD was released, we explained to customers the differences among the original book, the illustrated edition and the movie and offered buyers a chance to win a trip to France for The Da Vinci Code tour. Yes, we made money on the orders.”

“Online shopping offers customers several key benefits like (a) huge selection, (b) the store is open for business 24×7 and (c) the convenience of home delivery. These benefits are clear, concise and easy to communicate but here’s the problem—customers do not find these benefits compelling.
Take the factor of selection. Large offline bookstore chains like Landmark and Crossword typically stock around 50,000 unique titles in their flagship outlets whereas an online bookstore would have a catalogue of several million titles. It sounds compelling to tell a customer to buy books online because she can choose from a massive selection but in reality browsing through hundred thousand titles on Chinese history or fifteen thousand options on plain white socks for men can be cumbersome and sometimes selecting from just a few options is more convenient.
Take shopping hours. Online stores constantly promote the 24×7 feature by announcing that shoppers can shop online at their store at 2 a.m., which you cannot do at an offline store. This sounds persuasive but customers do not shop at odd hours. Once, I was talking to some students of a top management school, and I was going on and on, ad nauseam, about shopping at odd hours. After a while, a student got up and stumped me: ‘But why would I shop at 2 a.m? I would be fast asleep.’

There’s the convenience of home delivery but the reality is that customers value the convenience of home delivery as long as it is free. 

“In other words, the only real benefit e-commerce firms can use to attract shoppers is a price benefit. Right from the early days of e-commerce, companies like Amazon.com and Ebay.com have used price as a benefit to attract first-time customers, hoping that over time, once customers get habituated into shopping online, other benefits like huge selection, anytime shopping and convenience will override the price issue, and they will continue to shop online even without discounts. However, more than two decades later, online stores continue to use price and deep discounts as the key attraction because customers have not yet found the other benefits compelling enough in isolation”

“CRR is low because most customers shop online, thanks to deep discounts, and they stop shopping once discounts are reduced or removed.”

“Conventional logic suggests that investors want their portfolio companies to be valued higher. This is generally true but if valuations climb to insane levels, investors may actually lose.
Ideally, investors plan to exit their investments by getting acquired by a large global giant who will inevitably enter India or a local corporate biggie with interest in the domain. If the start-up can create huge awareness and show some useless metrics, however unhealthy, the decks can get decked up in anticipation of a transaction with a global giant.
There’s one problem though.
Global giants will do a detailed build vs buy analysis, evaluate the unique assets they will gain through an acquisition and compare this with how long they would take to create the same assets on their own.
Obviously, a low acquisition price makes a stronger argument to buy. Conversely, it makes no economic sense to acquire a local start-up at high costs because it would be cheaper to build their own business even though it may take a while longer. What this really means is that it is essential for start-ups to raise funds in line with true revenue growth and at realistic valuations to ensure they remain attractive enough to be acquired. Acquisitions in the $100 million range may occur but $5 billion or $10 billion deals are improbable. ”

“There are a plethora of single-category sites that have mushroomed in the past few years. Except for food and grocery which is inherently a tough category, it will be hard to build sustainable single-category businesses as an online retailer and battle high traffic horizontal sites, unless they craft exclusive, unique and hard-to-find merchandise or services, which no Indian vertical (except IRCTC) have managed so far. Globally, most successful single-category sites are extensions of an existing offline retail business.”
