I found multiple meanings of this song. Will leave you upto it.

First meaning

This song is the story of two beautiful phases of the day — mornings and evenings, and how the tragedy that they can never meet. Piqued by this curiosity, they resort to asking the night about each other. 

> शामें-सुबह मिलते नहीं<br>
ख़ालिद हैं पर दिलचस्प भी

ख़ालिद = permanent
दिलचस्प = interesting

That mornings and evenings never meet is a permanent fact, but that doesn’t stop it from being interesting.

> सुबह पूछे, "रात-शामें क्या हसीं?" <br>
शामें पूछे, "रात-सुबह क्या नयी?"

The morning asks the night, how beautiful the evenings are?
The evening asks the night, what is new with mornings?

> ज़ाकिर करे वो ज़ाहिर नहीं <br>
आक़िल हूँ मैं आसिम नहीं

ज़ाकिर = remember
ज़ाहिर = tell, reveal
आक़िल = intelligent
आसिम = all-knowing (guardian)

The night tries to remember the beauty of both, but is unable to convey it in its magnanimity.
She says she’s intelligent, but she is not all knowing.

> शामें-सुबह <br>
मिलना ज़रा

The second meaning was about a couple who don’t meet every morning or evening but are still permanent in each other’s life. In the morning they ask, what happened last night? In the evening they ask, how was the morning. They talk about things, but are unable to convey their emotions in full depth. It highlights the frustration of communication gap, and that they are not all-knowing. 

The third meaning was about lovers who don't meet anymore but still think about each other. They ask about each other's whereabouts. They remember each other but don't reveal that to anyone.
