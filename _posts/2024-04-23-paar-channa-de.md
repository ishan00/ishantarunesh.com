This song is about the tragic love story of Sohni and Mahiwal. 

**Backstory** - A rich trader once visit’s Sohni’s fathers pottery shop and he is love-struck seeing the beautiful Sohni. In order to win Sohni’s love, he starts helping her family in grazing the buffalo, thus getting the name Mahiwal (buffalo herder). But Sohni’s parents don’t want Sobhi to be married to him because he is from another community. They instead marry her away to someone is the nearby village. Mahiwal, dejected starts living as a fakir across the river (Chanab) from Sohni’s new house. 
Sohni used to swim across the Chenab river every night to meet Mahiwal. Now Chenab river is known its strong current. So in order to stay afloat Sohni used to carry an earthen pot (ghada).  The rumours of this affair start spreading and Sohni’s sister in law gets to know of it. So the (vicious) sister in law replaces baked pot with an unbaked pot (mitti). 

The actual song is the conversation going between Sohni and the ghada while she is swimming at night and the unbaked pot is dissolving

> Paar chana de disse kulli yaar di<br>
Ghariya ghariya aa ve ghariya

Sohni is request the ghada to take her across the river where her lover’s hut is

> Raat haneri nadi ṭhaaṭhaan maardi<br>
Adiye adiye haan ni adiye

The pot replies that the night is dark and the river is tumultuous too. The pot is helpless and asks Sohni not be be too stubborn

> Kacchi meri miṭṭi<br>
Kaccha mera naam ni<br>
Haan main na-kaam ni<br>
Ho main naakaam ni

The pot goes on to say that I can’t help that I am made of kacchi mitti. It’s not my name that is kaccha but it’s my composition and that even if I try I cannot carry you across the river.

> Kacchiyaan te rakkhiye na umeed paar di<br>
Adiye adiye haan ni adiye

Don’t keep your hopes on me to carry you through. 

> Yaar noon milegi ajj laash yaar di<br>
Ghadeya ghariya aa ve ghariya

She finally requests the ghada to take her at any cost even if she dies. Mahiwal will be greeted with the corpse of his lover
