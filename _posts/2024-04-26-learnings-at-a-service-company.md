Pros
- Getting to see a wide variety of projects across different industries. (variety of tech stacks, models etc explored on a daily basis)
- Getting to network with a lot of founders / CXOs (shallow network)
- Since cashflow isn’t an issue, less stress and certain to grow at a good pace

Unique skill to learn
- The ability to estimate the effort required to do a project. Becomes really important especially once you start taking longer term projects

Cons
- Since the problem statement is given by the client company, we don’t get to do other parts of product development such as market research, testing.
- Not getting to deliver very high quality projects. One of the likely reasons a services company is seeked out is to build a less feature, less costly version of a product out there. And since services is not inherently a high margin business, it would never make sense to refine the project to the last bit. (Basically we deliver around the minima of cost / feature or cost / accuracy graph)
- While the slope can be steeper, the growth will remain steeper. (So in a 10 year period it might be worth spending a few years searching for product ideas because long term better outcomes for product companies. Although I believe the expected value to still be higher for services)

What’s different at an AI service vs Tech (software development) service
- Modularisation is not easy. (effort doesn’t reduce in near future)
A development agency needs templates for each kind of app/website — e-commerce, dating, food delivery etc. The modules are more easily plug-and-play such as authentication, cart, checkout, payment etc. That’s something which is yet to be verified for AI projects — especially if they are data science projects. For chatbots, voicebots, document reading there is still potential for replicability. Leads to higher revenues
- Outcome is not known on day 1. The most crucial period for a project is the feasibility check and proposal drafting. Once the proposal has been agreed upon, it’s difficult to go back and ask for an increase in the quote. And usually we don’t know what accuracy will be achieved by the method we have in mind. Currently we are doing revenue based on accuracy buckets.
