X-axis -> Application of process skills
Y-axis -> Application of expertise

On the x-axis is facilitator, and on y-axis is expertise. An ideal consultant is one whose value add is along the diagonal
A facilitator brings people together, but doesn’t add an expertise himself — easily replaceable.

There is a difference between customer want and customer need. 

A primary flaw of unsuccessful consultants is that they accept client wants as their real need. The need is almost always beyond and above what is stated. If you deliver only the customer want, your value is not very great.

If you demonstrate to your client that the real underpinnings of the issue need to be addressed, you can broaden the project, best delight the client and charge higher fees. 

If you are a pair of hands and not a brain, then you are not a consultant, you’re a contractor. 
Most IT resources are simply doing — writing code, fixing bugs and testing new relationships. They are not brining their own intellectual capital or serving as partners and advisors to the chief information officer or chief technical officer. 

There are three dimensions to being a great consultant
Expertise / Content
Process
Trust

You can swiftly build trust by
Being introduced by a peer of the buyer
Having a commercially published book
Creating proprietary intellectual property and models
Behaving and dressing like a successful businessman
Offering value early and frequently

The advice in this book is to remain a generalist. 

If you find market need and have passion but don’t have the competency, you’l  lose to the competition. 
If you have competency and passion but can’t identify need, you have a story no one wants to hear.
If you have market need and competency but no passion, you have a nine-to-five job. And that’s an environment most of us have fled from.

Unless highly paid people bring in new business, they are not worth the money. Delivery people are a dime a dozen.
You will never be successful in this business charging by a time unit. And that is because it is unfair to the client and inequitable for you
Billing by value
Speed is rewarded
The client is better equipped to defend and justify the investment
There is no confusion about motive (if the consultant recommends something, it’s because it’s needed, not an excuse to bil  more hours).

Never  outsource  your  marketing,  because  this  is  a  relationship  business,  and  as  a  buyer,  I’d  be  offended  if  you  had  a  third  party  or subordinate contact me instead of trying to do so yourself. Outsource back-room work, not front-stage work.

Questions to Determine the Economic Buyer
1.  Whose budget wil  support this initiative?
2.  Who can immediately approve this project? 
3.  To whom wil  people look for support, approval, and credibility? 
4.  Who controls the resources required to make this happen? 
5.  Who has initiated this request? 
6.  Who wil  claim responsibility for the results? 
7.  Who wil  be seen as the main sponsor and/or champion? 
8.  Do you have to seek anyone else’s approval? 
9.  Who wil  accept or reject proposals? 
10.  If you and I were to shake hands, could I begin tomorrow?

Objectives
There are always business outcomes, never deliverables or inputs. They describe a component of  an improved client condition. Hence, these cannot be inputs, because a training program or a focus group does not improve the client’s condition, per se; it merely costs money!

Most consultants tend to bundle their products and services because they basically are insecure about their worth and want to provide as much stuff as they can to justify fees. That’s why my system  begins with conceptual agreement on outcomes and value.

One  of  the  absolute  worst  time  wasters  is  trying  to  maintain  and  administer  your  own  web  site  or  blog.  Be  the  content  expert,  not  the technical expert.

Gaining business through referral business from clients. 
Gaining business through repeat business from clients. 

That combination should amount to about 85 percent of your annual business. If you accompany that with my belief that you need to jettison the bottom 15 percent of your business every couple of years, then you can see that you’ll need to generate a modest amount of new business, but not that much.

In addition, you want to create new business for the following additional reasons:
Improve or change your markets. 
Learn new skills and gain new experiences. 
Gain credibility with your client list and diversity. 
Improve your visibility. 
Create more interest and fun.

On social media advertisements
“Most of the people scratching out an existence are those who are selling services such as how to market on social media platforms!”
