I wrote the [first post](/best-of-self-help-lessons) a year ago, covering 5 self-improvements ideas that I was trying to implement in my life. I have been exposed to many more ideas through books and videos. The methods mentioned below have been quite valuable in my life last year.

**Breaking down tasks into smaller chunks**

With a bad case of perfectionism, I was often overwhelmed when it came to big important tasks. They would remain in the todo lists for months. Overcoming the paralyzing grip of perfectionism has been a game-changer in my productivity. I have now started to break down those tasks into very small units and starting with the first one. For example I have planned many blog posts for the future. These are full length articles but I was not able to start on them. So what I do now is to write a single paragraph and upload it. In this process of writing the first paragraph, often I get the remaining thoughts to finish it in one setting. Otherwise, it revolves in my head and I am able to finish it in a few days. Waiting to have all the headings and subheadings before writing was hindering my output. Then there are other kinds of task you don’t really want to do -- such as chores but you know you have to. It helps to break them down too and just get over them. I make todo lists for chores at a granular level -- put shoe on shoe racks, water the plant, transfer money into account, clean fridge. 

**The gap and the gain**

Recognizing the detrimental role of perfectionism in my self-improvement journey was a revelation. In the process of setting a goal and then immediately falling short of it the next day, I would end up beating myself up for failing. Whenever we set out to achieve a goal, we look at how much more we could have done ideally. We are looking at the gap. Instead we need to only focus on the gain (how much we progressed from the start point). Makes the process sustainable and you much happier on the path.

**Leaving good things for better things**

This is an infliction a lot of people have. They need a strong reason to leave things. The relationship must turn bad for them to exit it. They job must lead them to breakdown for them to quit. That’s not the case. And I think if you are doing decently well in life that would never be the case for you. You would always have a good thing with yourself. And to move to great you’ll have to quit that good thing. And you can’t rely on the same analysis of “there has to be something wrong” in the current thing for you to seek more.

**Setting bigger goals**

A friend and I were writing our goal list together and I noticed that most of my goals were very achievable in 5 to 10 years period. None of my goals were too lofty, too ambitious. I have only been setting goals which are achievable with reasonable amount of hardwork. Maybe it’s a low self-confidence thing or the fear of failure but setting only achievable goals is like limiting your own growth. Having larger-that-life goals push us to exert our utmost effort. Even if the outcome is not what we hoped for, the journey itself becomes a triumph.
