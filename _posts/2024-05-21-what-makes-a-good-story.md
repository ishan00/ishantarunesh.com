Have you seen Drive To Survive? If not, you should watch S1 (Netflix). It’s a great example of how storytelling can transform the way you look at an event. F1, by the design of it, is a biased sport. A sport with rich teams — Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull competing for the top 3 spots and relatively poorer teams — competing for the last 5. If you are a casual viewer, why would you be interested in the story of Haas, or Williams? Drive To Survive changed that for the F1 audience. They make you care about teams that cameras don’t zoom in on, or commentators don’t talk about in races because they are too far behind Max Verstappen. 

If they were to make a movie on any one IPL team, I bet choosing RCB would make a better storyline than choosing MI. What’s MI’s story? The team with the biggest budget, with the biggest stadiums and a large supporter base? A team which was always top on the leaderboard (even in the years they got knocked out, they finished with more points than the winners). What’s so unimaginable about them winning 5 out of the 15 seasons? I imagine the day RCB would win the tournament, and that is all what guys would talk about for a whole year. 

All compelling stories follow the 4C framework.

It follows a Character with an overarching Challenge requiring them to come face-to-face with the Conflicts leading to the Climax. 

What makes a good challenge? The challenge **has to be** something the character is not already capable of achieving. Because what’s the fun if the challenge is already within your reach? To achieve or overcome the challenge, the character faces a conflict. Will he be able to do it? Does he have what it takes? Will the sacrifice be worth it? Think of any great story, the conflict involves the character to **change** in a certain way. That’s what we like about stories. All great stories are stories of change, the characters coming to terms with their past, characters breaking through their limited beliefs, characters changing their views. 

> “And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”
— Haruki Murakami

So what's your story? What's your challenge? Is it a story-worthy challenge?

Side Note - RCB doesn’t have a bad team. Instead they have bad luck. And that’s why their story is going to be the greatest! They are not competing with MI or CSK. They are competing with their bad luck. It's one of the biggest challenges to have — that the World is not in your favour. (wait for them to win).

I think the people who do great learn how to start from scratch every time something doesn’t work. They shed their identity of what they have been till now and get on with their new identity — forever amateurs. It’s an extremely difficult thing to do. If you come from a good family, study at a good school, or work at a good company, you are already someone, so the thought of becoming no one is frightening. The games you play are intended to prevent yourself from becoming “no one”. In that sense people who aren’t attached to any identity, have an advantage that they are free to become anyone. They flow quickly between things, and have an easy time making decisions because they don’t have to process the grief of losing their identity. 

So keeping your identity small would be a good way to make it less stressful to change the course of life. You’re not an engineer, or a lawyer or a consultant. You’re a 25 year old who has spent 7 years studying or working in engineering, law or consulting. You can have many more 7 years careers. 

Update - RCB qualified for playoffs. From losing 7 out of first 8 games to winning the next 6.
