“You know, Vaishnavi," he began, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, "When people talk about their partner making them happy, I believe there's something much deeper behind those words."

Vaishnavi turned in her seat, facing Arjun with a curious expression. "Go on, I'm listening," she said, intrigued by his introspection.

“Ice cream makes you happy, and so does listening to Indie songs, and if I remember correctly, attending Kanan Gill’s show last week made you happier than I have seen in months,” said Arjun. “But that’s not the feeling they are talking about, are they?”

"What they're really expressing is the full spectrum of emotions their partner evokes in them," Arjun continued, his voice steady. "While happiness is a significant part of it, it's just one piece of the puzzle. To reduce it solely to happiness would be to overlook the complexity of the relationship”

As they paused at a red light, Arjun stole a glance at Vaishnavi. "You know how I always tease you about your jokes?" he remarked.

Vaishnavi raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in her eyes. "Oh, so now it's my turn to be the subject?" she retorted, a playful smile on her lips.

“No, no, hear me out.  You’re terrible at jokes, but you still make me laugh everytime. I can’t help but chuckle at your clumsiness. I love your eagerness of trying out new cafes in Mumbai. You have this intuitive sense of when I've had a rough day at work, and you know just how to comfort me. And when you skip ordering your favorite mushrooms on date nights because you know I can't stand them, it makes me feel truly seen. And then there's your evil habit of eating Maggi with ketchup. But on a more serious note, your passion for your work is truly inspiring.” said Arjun. He turned to Vaishnavi, who was listening intently. He continued “And when you don’t pick up my call; a wave of sadness runs through my body. How many bad days have turned into worse because of it. And how can we forget about worry, oh, worry, and my god so much of it, for it is up there right next to happiness in the emotional pie of this relationship. And let's not forget occasional jealously too, for that guy in your office won’t stop hitting on you in parties.” 

He took a breath, "There's laughter, joy, surprise, assurance, affection, comfort, sacrifice, frustration, guilt, pride, and everything in between," he concluded. "What we have is a complex whirlwind of emotions bundled up into one beautiful mess."
