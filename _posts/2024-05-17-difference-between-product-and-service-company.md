This question is easy on the surface, but gets ambiguous as you probe. Product and services aren’t distinctly separable. Most companies (especially older ones) fall towards the extremes. A can of Pepsi is a product you buy, and so is an iPhone, a Volkswagen Polo or a shirt from Tommy Hifiger. On the other hand a car wash is a service you avail, and so is the hairdresser. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, chartered accountants, actors are all offering their service to others.

Food is tangible, physical things that Restuarants sell. So does that make Restaurants a product business? Do we pay the restaurant only for the food they cook? We’re also paying them for the seating space and serving food and the ambience. 

Are cloud kitchens then a pure product business? I think so, if they are not also providing the delivery, which is a service. 

Are car manufacturers pure product companies? The car is the product they sell, but they also sell annual servicing and maintenance services.

Products need not be physical tangible things. They can be digital. Youtube, Instagram, Games etc. are digital products on your phone.

Is marketplace a product? Yes, the platform is a product (which can scale non-linearly). So a marketplace is a pure product company if they aren’t involved in any logistics. OLX is one such example.

Is Zomato a product company then? Zomato has two offerings -- an app (marketplace) and then delivery (logistics) so it’s a mix of both product and service.

Is NoBroker a product company? At first it may seem like their offering is solely a marketplace for flats. But NoBroker has to rely on a large customer success / sales team to nudge their customers to rent/buy the flats. This is a service they have to operate in which doesn’t look very different than the brokers they set out to disrupt. (Additionally NoBroker also offers services like packers and movers, painting etc). 

Product companies are interesting to investors because they can scale exponentially. Services on the other hand will grow linearly with hours invested or size of team.
