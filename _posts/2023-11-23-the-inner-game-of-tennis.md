#### Chapter 1

In every challenge there are two games - the outer game and the inner game. Mastering the inner game is prerequisite to peak performance. 

When it comes to coaching - verbal coaching is highly ineffective. The authors highlights how when a person learning to swing a bat is overloaded with suggestions such as swing your bat higher, move your feet etc, they come under so much pressure to not make mistakes and follow through the advice that their motion seems very rigid. It’s better for the coach to play the shot themselves and ask the player to observe and then replicate. Too much instruction is worse than none. The secret to winning a game is not trying too hard. It should come through a state of relaxed concentration. 

There are two self within each - the teller self and the doer self. The kind of relationship between the teller and doer self determines one’s ability to translate his knowledge of technique into actions.

The teller self doesn’t trust the doer self. It is actually the self 1 taking the action, instead of the more competent self 2. That is why a players cheeks are pursed, his posture is rigid. All of this is not required to hit the backhand. By complaining too much and trying too hard, self 1 has produced tension and muscle conflict in the body. He is responsible for the error, yet condemns self 2 and undermines the confidence in self 2. 

In order to improve, learning to see non-judgementally is important. Don’t notice how bad or well something is happening.

It is the constant thinking activity of self 1, which interferes with the natural capabilities of self 2. Harmony between the two is possible when the mind is quiet and focused. 

It is the initial act of judgement which provokes a thinking process. First the player’s mind judges one of his shots as bad or good. If he judges it as bad, he begins thinking about what was wrong with it. Then he tells himself how to correct it. Then he tries hard, giving himself instructions as he does so. Finally he evaluates again.

Through this experience, I began to see how self 1 operated. Always looking for approval and wanting to avoid disapproval, this subtle ego-mind sees a compliment as a potential criticism. It reasons, “If the pro is pleased with one kind of performance, he will be displeased by the opposite. If he likes me for doing well, he will dislike me for not doing well.” The standard of good or bad has been established and the inevitable result was divided concentration and ego-interference. 

Chapter 1 Summary - Letting go of judgement. This will bring more harmony between self 1 and self 2.
