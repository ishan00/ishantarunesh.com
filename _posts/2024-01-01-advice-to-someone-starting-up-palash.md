* Talk to founders you know currently (Shobhit, Yash, Kshitij etc.) and ask them about their 0-1 journey. How did they stumble upon their idea. 
* You need interest / passion in an industry to stick it out until the first win. After that the pull will be strong enough to continue
* Sell first, build later. 
* There are two kinds of founders -- those who come from industry expertise, and the others are problem solvers. As problem solvers, you should stop instantly jumping to building solutions. Everyone should be in discovery phase until you start in delivery phase
* Since you come from problem solver background, you should observe people doing things inefficient stuff. Never ask about the solution directly, instead ask questions. But don’t just listen to what they say, also look at what they do.
* Other than evaluating your idea, you also need to evaluate how you work with your cofounders. Treat the first 6 months as an experiment of that. If there is an incompatibility you can all walk away without much loss.
* Don’t worry about the market size too much at the start, adjacent things open up as you start progressing. 
* With respect to (2), pick an industry where you have connects so that you can sit with different people in the industry to understand their problems. Without any connects, it would be difficult to get a meeting since you are not adding any value (the consultancy way is good because it adds value to both). Figure out your team advantages in a particular industry, then you can iterate faster.
* Both consultancy or internship are good way to get your foot in the door. The aim is to get as close as possible to the customers. Build relations in the industry.
* Don’t assume it will work, always be in this state of mind. Then what can you do to make it work.
* One of the biggest validator of an idea is someone is paying money or putting in a lot of effort to already solve it. That means the problem exists. Facebook had an internal knowledge base which was maintained by 7-8 developers. That means a spending of $1M. If facebook is spending a million dollar to solve it, the problem must exist elsewhere too. Someone has to demonstrate that they are putting effort or money to solve the problem and it should be an extrapolatable problem (not niche)
* Three factors to evaluate a potential idea <br>
Desirability - Do people want it? <br>
Feasibility - Can we build it? <br>
Viability - Can we make a business out of it?
