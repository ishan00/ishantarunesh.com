Some questions you could ask yourself are:

* What is the reason or goal for this activity?
* What benefit am I getting from this?
* Where is this activity taking me?

Knowing the why is the deepest and most powerful form of knowledge because the why is always the driver of the what and how. When you understand why the stock market goes up and down, making informed decisions about investing becomes easier. When you understand why someone does what they do, their actions and behaviors make a lot more sense.

There is always a why or goal behind human behavior. There is a purpose or reason for all human activity. The more conscious and clear you are about choosing your purpose and goals, the how begins to take care of itself. Your behavior follows your purpose and goals. Without conscious purpose, the how becomes conflicted and chaotic.

Approach motivations and avoid motivations are both goals. For instance, going to work because you donâ€™t want to lose your house is an avoidance-driven goal. Going to work to get a promotion is more approach-motivated.

All goals or motivations fit within two categories: approach or avoid.

Being driven by fear is a lower state of consciousness than being driven by courage and vision. Deep emotional development is required to transition beyond fear as your driver to levels of acceptance, courage, and love as reasons for action.
