I write about growing up, self-improvement, and general thoughts about life and career. Indexed below are all of my essays. The delightful part of maintaining a personal blog is the sudden thrill of writing down an original thought in the notes app, hoping it would someday appear on the blog, and Iâ€™ll share it with friends. Although I would like only to post original finished contributions, writing imperfectly is important to me to learn to give up on perfectionism, so I also upload partially completed drafts.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  {% if post.tags contains 'personal' %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a><span style="float:right">{{ post.date | date: "%b %Y" }}</span>
    </li>
   {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
