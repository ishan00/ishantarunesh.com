						<h4>Why we hesitate writing down our goals or to-dos</h4>
						<span class="date">May 26, 2022</span><br><br>

						<p>As someone who daydreams a lot, I struggle a lot with writing down what precisely is that I would like to do. It is not a lack of wishes but rather too many of them that are at the root of this problem. It’s easy to come up with things you would like to explore / work on / improve in the future. Sit without your phone for an hour and you’ll be able to come up with many. The hard part is when someone asks you to choose 1 or few out of them. In essence goal setting is not simply “what I want to do” but also “what I don’t want to do”. By setting goals (or systems or habits or other equivalent words) you are qualifying how you envision the future for yourself. That means letting go of many of the half-baked wishes in your head. You have to go through the sadness and grief of what you won’t do and who you’ll never be. We need to accept (and process) that by taking a path we are giving up on other paths (atleast for the time being) <br><br>

						<h4>On Insidious Addictions</h4>
						<span class="date">May 26, 2022</span><br><br>

						<p>Addiction is not always drinking, smoking, social media or pornography. Work could be an addiction, reading could be an addiction, you could be addicted to travelling and so on. Everything has a potential of becoming an addiction. The word potency refers to how easily you could become addicted to something. Sure potency is high for smoking or watching pornography but these activities are also ubiquitously known to be harmful or unhealthy. Everyone knows the adverse effect they have on physical or mental health. There are other things you can get addicted to which are seemingly normal or even healthy activity. Reading for example is a “good” activity. So is exercising or travelling. But when they start serving the purpose of escape, that’s when you need to be careful. You may be turning to these activity in order to numb yourself, from feeling of anxiety or overwhelm. The reason why I call these insidious because they are hard to identify and thus get in control. There is no evident “unhealthiness” attached to these activities, which was the case for smoking for example. You don’t feel guilty or bad doing it, on the contrary it gives you positive feeling of accomplishment, progress or excitement. No body in your vicinity points it out to you. But nonetheless these serve the exact same purpose of escape, running away and avoidance. You may be procrastinating doing a more important task by exercising or reading. <br><br>

						We need awareness to identify such an activity in our life and get in under control. Asking ourself if we can say no to it without feeling very guilty.

						<h4>Why certain embarrassments, humiliations and hurt stick with you?</h4>
						<span class="date">Jan 16, 2022</span><br><br>

						<p>I often find myself ruminating on the past, in particular on my interaction with others. Most times I am not even making a conscious choice to do so, to recall and repeat the conversations. There are always some remarks you can’t move past. They pop up every now and then and have a drastic effect on your mood. A day can easily turn bad with a small hint or trigger which brings in a train of catastrophic self-critical thoughts. I can’t figure out this small thing by myself, I can’t do this, I can’t do that etc. These remarks needn’t be verbal. It could be a dismissive tone of voice, a perceived look-down or simply an ignorance towards you.<br><br>

						But what kind of remarks or embarrassment hurt us the most? Stay with us the longest? I believe that they are the ones that make you feel helpless. When do you feel helpless? When the thing being talked about has a power over you and you are struggling with it. If you have struggled with losing weight and someone calls you on your weight it would give you a very hard time. The same remark for a person who has not struggled with weight won’t be affected by this remark (perhaps he/she has gained weight but knows that he/she can take control over his/her eating habits). They would forget it soon too.<br><br>

						These are also the remarks that mirror your inner critic. The reason it hurts is because YOU BELIEVE THEM TO BE TRUE. Somewhere within a part of you believes that and it is cruel that others have noticed it let alone call you out for it. These are the thoughts you have already internalised being echoed to you from outside. That is where the helplessness stems from.<br><br>

						In stand up comedy it is called punch-up and punch-down jokes. You’re allowed to do a joke which is punch-up i.e a joke about person who is better off than you for that context e.g making fun of a rich person for bad financial decision or about taxes. A punch-down joke would be making fun of a poor person for his way of living. It’s not that punch-up jokes don’t hurt the targeted person’s sentiment or feelings. They most certainly do. Regardless of how privileged you are, a criticism (especially an exaggerated one in comedy) would definitely make you feel embarrassed, sad, angry or indignant. It’s only human to feel that way. However the one thing it wouldn’t make you feel is hopeless and helpless about your situation. </p>
