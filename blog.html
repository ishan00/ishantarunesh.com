I write about growing up, self-improvement, and general thoughts about life and career. Indexed below are all of my essays. The delightful part of maintaining a personal blog is the sudden thrill of writing down an original thought in the notes app, hoping it would someday appear on the blog, and Iâ€™ll share it with friends.

<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
{% if post.tags contains 'personal' %}
  {% assign currentdate = post.date | date: "%B %Y" %}
  {% if currentdate != date %}
</ul>
    {{ currentdate }}
<ul>
    {% assign date = currentdate %} 
  {% endif %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
