I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. -- Sylvia Plath</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Twenty-seven hours before she decided to die, Nora Seed sat on her dilapidated sofa scrolling through other people’s happy lives, waiting for something to happen.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>She went on Instagram and saw everyone had worked out how to live, except her.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Still staring blankly at <strong>The Book of Regrets</strong>, she wondered if her parents had ever been in love or if they had got married because marriage was something you did at the appropriate time with the nearest available person. A game where you grabbed the first person you could find when the music stopped.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Nora’s grief fused with depression and anxiety and the feeling that her life was out of her own control. The wedding seemed such a symptom of this chaotic feeling, that she felt tied to a train track, and the only way she could loosen the ropes and free herself was to pull out of the wedding. Though, in reality, staying in Bedford and being single, and letting Izzy down about their Australia plans, and starting work at String Theory, and getting a cat, had all felt like the opposite of freedom.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>She never knowingly let go of the book, but there was a moment where she was no longer a person reading it, and a consequent moment where there was no book – or library – at all.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>I knew the answer but didn’t tell you because I didn’t want you to mock me. And now I don’t really care because I don’t think me knowing some things that you don’t should bother you.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘Want,’ she told her, in a measured tone, ‘is an interesting word. It means lack. Sometimes if we fill that lack with something else the original want disappears entirely. Maybe you have a lack problem rather than a want problem. Maybe there is a life that you really want to live.’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘So, you see? Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . .’ She searched for the appropriate term and found it. ‘A load of <strong>bullshit</strong>.’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>The more focused you were on the activity, the less focused you were on everything else. You kind of stopped being you and became the thing you were doing.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘Well, that you can choose choices but not outcomes. But I stand by what I said. It was a good choice. It just wasn’t a desired outcome.’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Maybe even suicide would have been too <strong>active</strong>. Maybe in some lives you just float around and expect nothing else and don’t even try to change. Maybe that was most lives.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘As soon as I started winning swimming races, I became <strong>seen</strong> and I didn’t want to be seen.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘Okay, Mrs Elm. I want to know what happened in the life where I did what my father wanted. Where I trained as hard as I possibly could. Where I never moaned about a five a.m. start or a nine p.m. finish. Where I swam every day and never thought about quitting. Where I didn’t get sidelined by music or writing unfinished novels. Where I sacrificed everything else on the altar of freestyle. Where I didn’t give up. Where I did everything right in order to reach the Olympics. Take me to where I am in <strong>that</strong> life.’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘People with stamina aren’t made any differently to anyone else,’ she was saying. ‘The only difference is they have a clear goal in mind, and a determination to get there. Stamina is essential to stay focused in a life filled with distraction. It is the ability to stick to a task when your body and mind are at their limit, the ability to keep your head down, swimming in your lane, without looking around, worrying who might overtake you . . .’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>She felt guilt, that her life had the power to shape her brother’s life in such meaningful ways.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Weirdly, she felt just as sad for the version of her who had never fallen in love with the simple beauty of Thoreau’s <strong>Walden</strong>, or the stoical Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, as she had felt sympathy for the version of her who never fulfilled her Olympic potential.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>It can drive you insane, thinking of all the other lives we don’t live.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>The lonely mind in the busy city yearns for connection because it thinks human-to-human connection is the point of everything. But amid pure nature (or the ‘tonic of wildness’ as Thoreau called it) solitude took on a different character. It became in itself a kind of connection. A connection between herself and the world. And between her and herself.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>This life was an intense one, without compromise. It was currently minus seventeen degrees, and she had nearly been eaten by a polar bear, and yet maybe the problem with her root life had partly been its blandness.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Maybe that’s what all lives were, though. Maybe even the most seemingly perfectly intense or worthwhile lives ultimately felt the same. Acres of disappointment and monotony and hurts and rivalries but with flashes of wonder and beauty. Maybe that was the only meaning that mattered. To be the world, witnessing itself. Maybe it wasn’t the lack of achievements that had made her and her brother’s parents unhappy, maybe it was the expectation to achieve in the first place. She had no idea about any of it, really. But on that boat she realised something. She had loved her parents more than she ever knew, and right then, she forgave them completely.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Nora had always had a problem accepting herself. From as far back as she could remember, she’d had the sense that she wasn’t enough. Her parents, who both had their own insecurities, had encouraged that idea.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>She imagined, now, what it would be like to accept herself completely. Every mistake she had ever made. Every mark on her body. Every dream she hadn’t reached or pain she had felt. Every lust or longing she had suppressed.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>She imagined accepting it all. The way she accepted nature. The way she accepted a glacier or a puffin or the breach of a whale.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>She imagined seeing herself as just another brilliant freak of nature. Just another sentient animal, trying their best.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>And in doing so, she imagined what it was like to be free.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>One thing I’ve noticed is that the other people I’ve met – the dozen or so – have all been around our age. All thirties or forties or fifties. One was twenty-nine, en fait. All have had a deep desire to have done things differently. They had regrets. Some contemplated that they may be better off dead but also had a desire to live as another version of themselves.’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘I have been so many things. On every continent on Earth. And yet I have never found the life for me. I am resigned to being this way for ever. There will never be a life that I truly want to live for ever. I get too curious. I get too much of a yearning to live another way. And you don’t need to make that face. It’s not sad. I am happily in limbo.’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘But you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life,’ he said, wisely.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘There are patterns to life . . . Rhythms. It is so easy, while trapped in just the one life, to imagine that times of sadness or tragedy or failure or fear are a result of that particular existence. That it is a by-product of living a certain way, rather than simply <strong>living</strong>. I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.’</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>‘You need to choose more lives from the bottom or top shelves. You have been seeking to undo your most obvious regrets. The books on the higher and lower shelves are the lives a little bit further removed. Lives you are still living in one universe or another but not ones you have been imagining or mourning or thinking about. They are lives you could live but never dreamed of.’</span></p>
